# maeel

![](./preview.png)

### a minimalistic stack based programming language.

The interpreter is made of ~ 600 lines of code :3 Indeed a lot of maeel features are implemented in itself (stack functions, while loop, for loop, arrays, functional programming utilities...) (c.f. [maeel.maeel](maeel.maeel))

## Compile

`$ make test` (c.f. [tests.maeel](./stdlib/tests.maeel))

`$ make bench`

`$ make`

## Run program

`$ ./maeel program.maeel`

## Implemented in maeel

- Stack functions (drop, dup, rot, over, swap)
- Booleans functions (and, or, not)
- Conditions (ifelse, then)  (s/o Turring)
- Loops (while, for)
- Lists definition (List ... end)
