# maeel

### a minimalistic stack based programming language.

The interpreter is made of ~ 800 LoC (much less without comments) :3 Indeed a lot of maeel features are implemented in itself (stack functions, while loop, for loop, functional programming utilities...) (c.f. [maeel.maeel](maeel.maeel))

## Compile

`$ make test`

`$ make bench`

`$ make`

## Run program

`$ ./maeel program.maeel`

## Hello, world!

```
"Hello, world" puts
```
